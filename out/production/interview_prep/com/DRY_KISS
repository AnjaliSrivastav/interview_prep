KISS
---------
keep coding simple and straightforward. Keep your methods small. Each method should never be more than 40-50 lines.
Each method should only solve one small problem, not many use cases. If you have a lot of conditions in the method, break these out into smaller methods. 
It will not only be easier to read and maintain, but it can help find bugs a lot faster.
